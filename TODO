Planned Features:
* Better setup.py based installer
* Optional CSD (Headerbars), configured by settings and build
* Rename widgets for autopilot, including GtkWindow to CatfishWindow
* Add support for Tracker
* Allow editing of search methods used (locate, find, python-walk)
* Install pkexec policy to run updatedb instead of own SudoDialog.
  - Note that this will like require a new catfish-updatedb binary

Other:
* Improve glade editing. To edit the UI files, launch glade with:
  'GLADE_CATALOG_SEARCH_PATH=./data/ui glade ./data/ui/*.ui'
