Description: A file searching tool which is configurable via the command line.
 Catfish is a handy file searching tool for linux and unix. Basically it is a frontend for different search engines (daemons) which provides a unified interface. The interface is intentionally lightweight and simple, using only Gtk+3. You can configure it to your needs by using several command line options.
 .
 Supported backends are currently find, (s)locate, doodle, tracker and beagle.
